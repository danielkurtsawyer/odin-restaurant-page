# odin-restaurant-page
Github repository for the restaurant page project in the Odin Project's JavaScript course.

This project is mostly concerned with getting comfortable and familiar using webpack to bundle our code and assets. 
Additionally, this project aims to further develop DOM manipulation skills through dynamically rendering website pages with JavaScript. 

I used the style-loader and css-loader to inject my source css into the index.html file, and used webpack's built in asset modules to optimize images and fonts into the distribution folder. Of course, webpack also handled bundling my main index.js file with the other modules I created for dynamic page rendering. 

A live preview of this site can be found here: https://danielkurtsawyer.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/.

I'd like to dedicate this project to my friend Tim, the owner of the restaurant, for his kindness and continued friendship, not to mention all of the delicious food I have enjoyed at his food truck over the years.
